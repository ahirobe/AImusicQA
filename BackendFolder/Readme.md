SPOT-AI Music Recommendation Bot

WHAT IT DOES:
SPOT-AI is a bot that can recommend music (songs, artists, etc.) to users using a simple prompt-and-answer format. However, because we are using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 as well as Spotify's API in our project, the bot is capable of looking through Spotify's database to answer general music questions (i.e. How many albums does Drake have?). 

HOW TO USE:
First, download the requirements.txt file located in the recommender folder. (NOTE: We've found that we need to download an older version of LangChain in order for the PALChain import to work.)
